This page is a tutorial about how to setup Xen on Hikey960, it is based on the xen
wiki official web tutorial(https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/HiKey960).Since there are
several places easily got comfused, I decide to sum up all steps I did.

#Hikey960 Version

Before getting down to doing this, should be aware that there are two kinds of different
hikey960, the earliest version hikey960 has 3GB DRAM, and the latest version has updated
its DRAM to 4GB. In my experience, it is munch easier to enable xen on later one.
